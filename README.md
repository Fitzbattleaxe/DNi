### A D'ni Timepiece App for Android

Keep track of time and date with the method used by the ancient D'ni! This lovely polar clock keeps you on time with the cavern's algal cycle, as well as the units of time used by the D'ni.

* The *hahr* is roughly equivalent to one Earth year.
* One *vailee* is roughly equivalent to one Earth month.
* One *yahr* is equal to about 30 hours and 14 minutes of surface time
* One *gahrtahvo* is equal to about 6 hours and 3 minutes of surface time.
* One *pahrtahvo* is equal to about 1 hour 13 minutes of surface time.
* One *tahvo* is equal to about 14.5 minutes of surface time.
* One *gorahn* is equal to about 35 seconds of surface time.
* One *prorahn* is equal to about 1.5 seconds of surface time.
